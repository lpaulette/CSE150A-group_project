## Abstract

Notebook: https://colab.research.google.com/drive/18eC4kIxlNfqhwCORhM1Qsca9e1E-A3tj?usp=sharing

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/asinow/schizohealth-dataset

It will be a model-based agent. Our probabilistic agent will decide whether a patient should be put on suicide watch based on the probability that they will attempt suicide given their medical history. Specifically, if P(Y = 1 | X_1, X_2, ..., X_n) > 60%, the agent will decide to put the patient on suicide watch.

### PEAS
 - Performance Measure: prediction accuracy based on historical data.
 - Environment: a hospital, or psychiatrist/doctorâ€™s office
 - Actuators: decision of committing a patient to suicide watch based on likelihood of a suicide attempt.
Likely: if P(suicide attempt) > 60%, then: commit patient
 - Sensors: Schizophrenia diagnosis, age, gender, income level, employment status, disease duration, number of hospitalizations and substance use.

### Probabilistic model

Our agent is set up with a Noisy-OR probabilistic model. Dependencies are set as followed:

## Description of dataset
This dataset is a collection of demographic, clinical and psychosocial history information from schizophrenia patients. We decided to use our probabilistic agent to analyze how the probability of the 'Suicide Attempt' feature is affected by the rest of the features in the dataset ('Diagnosis', 'Gender', 'Income level', etc.).

The variables we're considernig are as follows:
 - Age - patient's age between 18 and 80 years old.
 - Gender - 0: Female, 1: Male.
 - Education level - 1: Primary, 2: Middle School, 3: High School, 4: University, 5: Postgraduate.
 - Marital status - 0: Single, 1: Married, 2: Divorced, 3: Widowed.
 - Ocuppation - 0: Unemployed, 1: Employed, 2: Retired, 3: Student.
 - Income level - 0: Low, 1: Medium, 2: High.
 - Living area - 0: Rural, 1: Urban.
 - Diagnosis - 0: Not schizophrenic, 1: Schizophrenic.
 - Disease duration: Duration of illness for schizophrenia patients (1-40 years).
 - Substance use - 0: No, 1: Yes (Tobacco, alcohol, or other substances).
 - Hospitalizations - Number of hospital admissions (ranges from 0 to 10 for schizophrenia patients).
 - Family history -  0: No, 1: Yes (Genetic predisposition).
 - Stress factors - 0: Low, 1: Medium, 2: High.
 - Social support - 0: Low, 1: Medium, 2: High.
 - Medication adherence - 0: Poor, 1: Moderate, 2: Good.

## Methods

We used the EM algorithm that's in HW3 to calculate the independent probability  p_i  for each feature x_i.

## Challenges
We had to divide certain features into categories to turn them into binary variables. Specifically, these features were:
- Age - divided into 3 binary variables ->
  - age_18_30 - 1: patient is between 18 to 30 years old, 0: else.
  - age_31_50 - 1: patiens is between 31 to 50 years old, 0: else.
  - age_51_80 - 1: patient is between 51 to 80 years old, 0: else.
- Education - divided into 5 binary variables ->
  - primary - 1: patient only reached primary school, 0: else
  - middle_school - 1: patient only reached middle school, 0: else
  - highschool - 1: patient only reached highschool, 0: else 
  - university - 1: patient only reached university, 0: else
  - postgrad - 1: patient reached postgrad, 0: else
- Marital status - divided into 4 binary variables ->
  - single - 1: patient is currently single, 0: else.
  - married - 1: patient is currently married, 0: else.
  - divorced - 1: patient is currently divorced, 0: else.
  - widowed - 1: patient is currently widowed, 0: else.
- Occupation - divided into 4 binary variables ->
  - unemployed - 1: patient is currently unemployed, 0: else.
  - employed - 1: patient is currently employed, 0: else.
  - retired - 1: patient is currently retired, 0: else.
  - student -  1: patient is currently a student, 0: else.
- Years with the disease - divided into 4 binary variables ->
  -  0_to_5_with_disease - 1: patients has had schizophrenia for 0 to 5 years, 0: else.
  -  6_to_15_with_disease - 1: patients has had schizophrenia for 6 to 15 years, 0: else.
  -  16_to_30_with_disease - 1: patients has had schizophrenia for 16 to 30 years, 0: else.
  -  31_to_40_with_disease - 1: patients has had schizophrenia for 31 to 40 years, 0: else.
- Number of hospitalizations - divided into 2 binary variables ->
  - less_than_5_hospitalizations - 1: patient has had less than 5 hospitalizations, 0: else.
  - more_than_5_hospitalizations - 1: patient has had more than 5 hospitalizations, 0: else.
- Medication adherence - changed to 1 binary variable ->
  -  low_medication_adherence - 1: patient has low medication adherence, 0: else.
- Social support - changed to 1 binary variable ->
  - Social_support - 1: patient has any amount of social support, 0: patient has no social support.  
- Level of stress - changed to 1 binary variable ->
  - High_stress - 1: patient has high levels of stress, 0: patient has low or medium levels of stress.

Example: age ranges from 18-80 years old. We created three cause nodes for three age ranges: {[18-30], [30, 50], [50, 80]}.
Subsequently, we replaced the 'Age' column for these three columns where if the patient is 20 years old, 'age_18_30' = 1, 'age_31_50' = 0, and 'age_51_80' = 0.

### Code used to categorize features

## Results

We created a test function that will get the probability of a suicide attempt based on a patient's history. <br>

<img width="542" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1aa458a9-532b-430b-a076-8c1005739b5e" /> <br>

Based on these tests, men with schizophrenia are more likely to attempt suicide than women. The diagnosis of schizophrenia also affects the likelihood severely (more than 3 times). <br>

We also testes based on marital status. <br>

<img width="299" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bae58eae-2667-4716-8ffa-e0c8f7442bd3" /> <br>

Based on these results, divorced men are the most likely to attempt suicide.

## Accuracy

We tested accuracy by calculating the probability of a suicide attempt for all the patients in the dataset and comparing them with the corresponding values of the suicide attempt feature.

Firt we extracted the suicide attempt values from the data frame: <br>

Secondly, for all the patient histories in the data set we calculate the probability of a suicide attempt. Then based on the agent's decision which, depends on a threshold, we claissify it as a 1 if the agent decides the patient should be put on suicide watch or 0 else.<br>

<img width="459" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c5cd4fb0-974a-4c06-bad9-f6c0c1203e6c" />

Then we compare the number of predictions our agen predicted correctly, and calculate the accuracy based on that number. <br>

<img width="455" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d4858de-86ad-475b-8cf3-fc01fc629e88" /> <br>

With a threshold of 70%, the accuracy is as follows: <br>
<img width="109" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b8a64f74-027d-45cc-a03f-6b6943af28cc" />

With athreshold of 60%: <br>
<img width="123" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d39ce7cb-be94-42ed-9faa-6499539b662e" />

With a threshold of 40%: <br>
<img width="98" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e7805dde-a38f-4c82-8dd5-93a79f126d07" />

With a threshold of 30%: <br>
<img width="115" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03e044ee-ce19-4e3f-89c0-945c8221ffd9" /> <br>

A 60% threshold has the best accuracy, since for anything lower than that the accuracy spikes down. <br>

## Precision vs Recall

<img width="418" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a969c044-f491-4ebd-8c0d-a9819f31d6d2" /> <br>

<img width="402" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/edf57a60-8fc1-45c3-845e-02b322e07e5e" /> <br>

Due to the serious consequences of having missed cases of suicide attempts, we don't mind sacrificing a low precision for a high recall score. In other words, we are more worried about not putting high-risk individuals in suicide watch. We have the following measurements: <br>
- 30% threshold, we get a recall score of 100% and a precision of 8.84%
- 40% threshold gives recall of 100% and precision of 8.87%
- 60% threshold gives recall of 100% and precision of 14.7%
- 70% threshold gives recall of 99.3% and precision of 27.34%

A 60% threshold is the threshold with the highest precision which has a recall of 100%, which is ideal for this context. Thus, we decide on a threshold of 60%.

## What's next

- Maybe add weights to certain features depending on how much they affect the probability of a suicide attempt.
- Further categorize non-binary features.
- Make multiple noisy-ORs models for demographic features, medical history features, and psychosocial features.
