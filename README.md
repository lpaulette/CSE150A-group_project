# Abstract

Our probabilistic agent will decide whether a patient should be put on suicide watch based on the probability that they will attempt suicide given their medical history. It will be a model-based agent. Its PEAS are:
Performance Measure: prediction accuracy based on historical data.
Environment: a hospital, or psychiatrist/doctorâ€™s office
Actuators: decision of committing a patient to suicide watch based on likelihood of a suicide attempt.
Likely: if P(suicide attempt) > 60%, then: commit patient
Sensors:
Schizophrenia diagnosis, age, gender, income level, employment status, disease duration, number of hospitalizations and substance use.
