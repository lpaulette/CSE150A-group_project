# Abstract

The agent we are trying to implement will be a utility based agent. The Performance measure will aim to maximize returns, minimize losses, etc. The Environment will be within the stock market conditions and trading platforms. The Actuators would be buying, selling and holding stock. The sensors would be the stock prices.

Our reasoning algorithm will analyze the Amazon stock market data to maximize our desired outcome.
Our probabilistic agent will be an Amazon stock trading agent that will predict the best day to buy and the best day to sell Amazon stock.

PEAS:
Performance measure: profit, loss
Environment: Fluctuation of Amazon stock prices over time, state of the stock market, inflation, state of stock market indexes such as S&P 500 and NASDAQ, Amazon revenue history, state of the retail market, state of the subscribers' expenditure. 
Actuators: Selling, buying, holding, and trading stock.
Sensors: Predictions of our algorithms based on data.
