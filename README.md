# Abstract

Our probabilistic agent will decide whether a patient should be put on suicide watch based on the probability that they will attempt suicide given their medical history. It will be a model-based agent. Its PEAS are:
 - Performance Measure: prediction accuracy based on historical data.
 - Environment: a hospital, or psychiatrist/doctorâ€™s office
 - Actuators: decision of committing a patient to suicide watch based on likelihood of a suicide attempt.
Likely: if P(suicide attempt) > 60%, then: commit patient
 - Sensors: Schizophrenia diagnosis, age, gender, income level, employment status, disease duration, number of hospitalizations and substance use.

   Our agent is set up with a Noisy-OR probabilistic model. Dependencies are set as followed:
